            <b>Project Title</b>: Focal Point Analysis for Trusted Machine Learning</p>

        <p>

                Investigators</b>: Dustin Arendt, Yi Huang, Jean Scholtz</p>

            <b>
                Protocol and Consent Title</b>: Trust in Automated Systems Experiment </p>

        <p>You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study. </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Purpose</b>: The purpose of this study is to look at trust in automated systems and how various explanations
            of how the system reached a prediction impact user’s trust and willingness to accept the prediction. </p>

        <p>
            <b>Exclusion/Inclusion Criteria</b>: You must be at least 18 years old to participate in this study. </p>

        <p>
            <b>Procedure</b>: If you decide to participate in this experiment you will be asked to use different automated classifiers
            with two different datasets. You will be trained in each classifier prior to using it. You will be given a
            <q>trust meter</q> and be introduced on how to use it. For each classifier, you will be given a number of trials. In each
            trial, the classifier will provide a recommendation and you can either follow or do not follow the recommendation. Additionally,
            you will be able to adjust the
            <q>trust meter</q> at any time when your trust in the classifier changes. </p>

        <p>
            <b>Risks or Discomforts</b>: There should be no risks or discomforts other than sitting at a computer for up to
            120 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Benefits</b>: Participants will not receive any benefits from this experiment with the exception of being exposed
            to a novel automated classifier with a visual explanation of its decision. </p>

        <p>
            <b>Compensation to You</b>: You will be given a work package for up to 4 hours for your participation in this research study.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Confidentiality</b>: Your participation in this research is confidential. We will take every precaution to ensure
            the security of your data. To minimize the risks to confidentiality, we will encode all data with a participant
            ID code of the form: Participant##. No part of the participant ID code contains any personal identifying information
            about you. Because this study involves multiple testing sessions, during your participation, we will maintain
            a code sheet that helps us properly identify which code has been assigned to you using only your initials. This
            code sheet is stored in a locked cabinet in a locked room when no investigators are present. As soon as all sessions
            are over, the code sheet linked to your initials will be destroyed. You will not be identified in any published
            reports; no findings will be linked to a specific study participant.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Participant Rights</b>: Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study if
            you don’t want to be. You have the right to change your mind and leave the study at any time without giving any
            reason and without penalty. If you decide not to finish the study, you have the right to withdraw any data collected
            about you. Should you decide to withdraw from the study, any electronic data will be deleted. You will be given
            a copy of this consent form to keep. You do not waive any of your legal rights by signing this consent form.</p>
