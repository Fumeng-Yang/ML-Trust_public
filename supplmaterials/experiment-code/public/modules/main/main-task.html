        <p class="pid-eid"></p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <p>You have 4 classifiers to test out.</p> Each classifier will work with you for a series of leaves. They make
        a recommendation for which class a leaf belongs to. Diffierent classifiers work in different ways. The same classifier
        works in the same way for a series.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the classifiers make a correct recommendation about 70-90% of the time. Some might be better; some might be worse.
        <b>The goal here is to make a good decision -- follow the classifier when it is correct, and do not follow the classifier
            when it is incorrect.
        </b>
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        Rejecting an classifier for incorrectness is as good as following a classifier for correctness. However, following a classifier
        for incorrectness is as bad as rejecting a classifier for correctness.
